title:  Dave's Color Wheels
version: "2.2.0"
summary:  Puzzle Game
description: |
  Daves Color Wheels is a puzzle in which you have to turn wheels to make a color from the Start to the Finish. Whatever color you choose to put in the Start Position is the color that has to continue through to the End. There is also a little twist. At level 15, a worm race begins. The color of the puzzle you solve will advance that same color worm. The game will tell you what color worm has to win to go to a bonus round (There will be 3 bonus rounds) Can you solve all 3 bonus rounds? We didn't include a save feature on this one. You'll just have to stick with it until you solve all 3 bonus rounds or just keep your computer on.  OH, after the 3rd bonus round you may as well just quit because we included enough 'Wheels Puzzles' to last longer than your fingers can click! ;-D
